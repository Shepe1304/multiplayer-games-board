## Notes

The biggest challenge I encountered was to make the website visually appealing and follow my chosen theme of gaming. I experimented with different colors and images, and finally settled with the final product. Another very interesting conundrum for me was to brainstorm all the features that a potential user would find helpful. I included all features, such as category tags and filters, for myself and other users to navigate my website with utmost convenience and enjoyment.
